# Learn BabylonJS to Create Your Own 3D Metaverse Environments

Users expect immersive experiences that can not only be entertaining but create engagement and retention.

This workshop will explore some of the theory around user perception while learning the Babylon.js library for creating 3D environments in a web browser.

Additional hands-on sections explore extending this environment to include live streaming media and communications between participants in that metaverse environment. For real-time interactivity with sub-second latency we'll cover some of the same techniques with WebRTC being used by major companies for broadcast quality workflows.
